"""Execution strategy
    
    Place Buy limit order at a certain price of entry and place sell limit 
    order below a certain price below to exit at loss. 
    Then place a buy limit order at the sell limit order used and calculate 
    the percentage  required to recover loss + profit to determine 
    new Sell limit order price.
    
    
    Example usage
    I set buy limit order at $ 10 and went long with a sell limit order of 
    $11 for profit and set Loss limit order at $ 5. 
    Now price fall to $5 and sell limit order was triggered so I sold at a lost.
    Price fell further to $1 and when got to $2, I went long gain and set new sell 
    limit order at $5 which was successful.
    
    If I started with 1000$ for trading, this will be the case.
    1. 1000/10 -> 100 shares initially
    2. Amt after selling at 5 -> 500 hence loss f 500
    3  500/2 -> 250 shares for new buy price
    4. 250 * $5 -> $1250 -> After selling at new price
    Profit = 1250 - 1000 -> 250
    
    In a case where the initial goal of $11 was achieved then, 
    profit = 1100 - 1000 -> 100
    
    In the case of do nothing and wait for price, then I would have 
    ended the day with loss of $500. Hence stop losses when implemented well
    can actually be beneficial to revert a lossing trade to profit.
    Lot of calculations need to be done to determine this entry and exit points.

well, I asses the 1% compounding interest (1 ci) to better

on the stock market is more achieveable than 3% because my strategy
